# Learning_WebDev
This is a repository of my adventure learning Web Development. I will do my best to organize it so anyone can use it!
I will add dated logs about my journey for those interested. If I get enough comments I will create a more organized repo going from basics to advanced HTML, CSS, JS.

    I have currently been pushing my levels of CSS, CSS is an underappreciated language which can allow a developer to show of their more artistic side. 
    CSS has a lot deeper functionality than many students or new Web Developers think it does. Personally I thought you would have to use JS for everything.
    Low and behold, CSS is full of functionality, so dont throw it to the side just for its simplicity.
